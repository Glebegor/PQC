    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This function implements the SPHINCS+ (Stateless Practical Hash-based Incredibly Nice Cryptographic Signature) algorithm.\n",
    "SPHINCS+ is a post-quantum secure digital signature scheme that is designed to be secure against attacks by both classical and quantum computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Math model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Signing\n",
    "The signing process in Sphincs involves creating a digital signature for a given message. This is achieved through a series of cryptographic operations that ensure the authenticity and integrity of the message. The steps include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Message Hashing**: The message is hashed using a secure hash function to produce a fixed-size hash value.\n",
    "2. **Tree-based Signature Generation**: The hash value is used to generate a signature using a tree-based structure, such as a Merkle tree. This involves creating a series of hash values that form the nodes of the tree, with the final signature being derived from the root of the tree.\n",
    "3. **Signature Output**: The final signature is a combination of the hash value and the tree-based signature, which can be used to verify the authenticity of the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Verification\n",
    "The verification process in Sphincs involves checking the validity of a given digital signature. This is done by performing the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Signature Decomposition**: The received signature is decomposed into its constituent parts, including the hash value and the tree-based signature.\n",
    "2. **Message Hashing**: The original message is hashed using the same secure hash function used during the signing process to produce a hash value.\n",
    "3. **Tree-based Signature Verification**: The tree-based signature is verified by reconstructing the tree structure and comparing the root hash value with the one derived from the signature.\n",
    "4. **Signature Validation**: If the hash values match and the tree-based signature is valid, the signature is considered authentic, and the message is verified. If any of the checks fail, the signature is deemed invalid.\n"
