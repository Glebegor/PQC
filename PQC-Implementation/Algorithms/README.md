# PQC implementation
## Description

This document provides an overview and implementation details of various Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms. These algorithms are designed to be secure against quantum computer attacks, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of data in the quantum computing era.

## Algorithms

### Kyber
Kyber is a key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) based on the hardness of the Learning With Errors (LWE) problem. It is designed for secure key exchange and encryption.

### Dilithium
Dilithium is a digital signature scheme based on the hardness of the Module Learning With Errors (MLWE) problem. It provides strong security guarantees and efficient performance.

### SPHINCS
SPHINCS is a stateless hash-based signature scheme that offers strong security and fast verification times. It is designed to be secure against quantum attacks.

### Falcon
Falcon is a lattice-based digital signature scheme that provides strong security and efficient performance. It is based on the NTRU lattice problem.
